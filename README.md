# Project Outline (Done on 02-03-2023)

## opencv-object-recognition

**Goal: To create a drone that can recognize your hand signals and move accordingly. This is mainly to learn a lot about AI.**

(If the drone with regards to budget doesn’t work out, we can attempt to change computer volume with hand signals).

_How? – In python_
-	Learn about Keras in tensorflow; find an AI model that would work for our project.
    -	Learn what AI models are.
    -	Learn how to create a model in python.
    -	Learn how to import our dataset into this model with formatted data.
        -	Formatted Data – using opencv to connect our camera with the data that Kaggle provides. Check #opencv-object-recognition. A lot of image processing.
-	Learn how to use opencv to view the contents of the camera.
