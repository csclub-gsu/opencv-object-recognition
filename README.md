# opencv-object-recognition

Proposed by @JustKiNG#7390 on discord

Goal: to use a camera (from laptop or outside source) to identify objects.

https://opencv-java-tutorials.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

Ideas: 
Traffic pathing: Could attach camera onto front dash and track traffic lights. patterns etc. and determine the best route to take based on past data.

Hand tracking:
Maybe an intro to some stuff into VR and AR 

Motion controls:
for dorm lamp, with a smart light.
Start out with laptop camera first, with a gesture or static pose, then move onto separate camera mounted somewhere where it can see door way.
